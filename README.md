# Personal Portfolio

This is code for my personal website. I have used plain HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for building this website. The entire idea for designing this website is taken from here(https://brittanychiang.com/). I tried to remake this ReactJS website into HTML.

This website showcases my previous experience and some of my important projects. If you like this website and my project, and want to connect with, below are some of the social profile.
